file.  Then run GizmoTester to test your code.  Modify GizmoTester as needed
to run more tests that will verify your code.

For question #2, write your response to part (a) in the CheckDigit.java file.
Then run CheckDigitTester to test your code.  Modify CheckDigitTester as needed

Note that in the Course Description, this is part (b).  Part (a) from the course

For this reason, a solution for getCheckDigit() is included here.
